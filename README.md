A simple block game made in opengl(similar to Miniclipâ€™s Bloxorz)

The game has 3 levels.
note-first level is just to get the hang of the game.

controls:

arrow keys for movement
q to quit
t for topview
y for towerview (pressing y again leads to change in towerview)
u for followcam
i for helicam (pressing i again resets the cam), then use mouse to move the view.
o for block view (pressing o again changes the side)

ENJOY!
